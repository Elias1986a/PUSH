## Whisper Models

PUSH uses OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition. Choose the model that fits your needs:

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Whisper Tiny | 75 MB | Very Fast | Good | Quick transcription, slower computers |
| Whisper Base | 150 MB | Fast | Better | Balanced speed and accuracy |
| Whisper Small | 500 MB | Slower | **Best** | **Highest quality (Recommended)** |

**Which should I choose?**
- **Whisper Small** - Recommended for most users. Best transcription quality.
- **Whisper Base** - Good balance if you want faster processing
- **Whisper Tiny** - Choose if you have an older Mac or need very fast results

**Where are models stored?**
```
~/Library/Application Support/PUSH/models/
```

You can delete models you're not using to free up disk space.

## Permissions Explained

PUSH needs two permissions to work:

### Microphone Access
- **Why?** To record your voice when you hold the hotkey
- **When?** Only while you're holding the Right Option key
- **Privacy:** Audio never leaves your computer

### Accessibility Access
- **Why?** To detect when you press the hotkey and to insert text into apps
- **When?** Required for the app to work
- **Privacy:** PUSH only monitors the specific hotkey you choose

**Your privacy is protected:** All voice processing happens on your Mac. Nothing is sent to the internet.

## Troubleshooting

### Upgrading from v1.0.0: Permissions Not Working

If you upgraded from v1.0.0 and the hotkey doesn't work:

1. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
2. Remove PUSH from:
   - Accessibility
   - Microphone
   - Full Disk Access (if present)
3. Quit PUSH completely
4. Relaunch PUSH from Applications
5. Accept permission prompts when they appear

This is only needed when upgrading from v1.0.0 due to signature changes. Fresh installs work normally.

### Other Issues

- **No permission prompts appear:** Open System Settings manually and add PUSH to Accessibility and Microphone
- **Hotkey not responding:** Make sure PUSH is enabled in Accessibility settings
- **No transcription:** Check that a Whisper model is downloaded in Settings → Models
